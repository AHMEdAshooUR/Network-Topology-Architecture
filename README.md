# Network Topology and Architecture Project

## 📌 Introduction
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a computer network topology and its architecture.  
The goal is to provide an efficient, secure, and scalable network infrastructure suitable for organizations or educational environments.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand different types of network topologies (Star, Mesh, Bus, Ring, Hybrid).  
- Design a network that meets performance, security, and scalability requirements.  
- Document the network architecture including IP addressing, devices, and protocols used.  
- Simulate and test the network using specialized tools (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3).

## 🏗️ Project Contents
- **Network Diagrams:** Detailed topology design.  
- **Architecture Documentation:** Explanation of chosen design and components.  
- **Configuration Files:** Router, switch, and firewall configurations (if applicable).  
- **Testing & Validation:** Results of connectivity and performance testing.  

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Cisco Packet Tracer / GNS3** – for simulation.  
- **Routers & Switches** (simulated)  
- **IP Addressing Plan**  
- **Basic Security Features:** Access lists, VLANs, etc.
